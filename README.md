## 💡 Lessons Learned
In this Project, I use hooks specifically useEffect to controle the useCallback which renders the change only when the dependencies changes same with useEffect but there are some more use case but this is the one I use. I also implemented useState() very clearly and tailwindcss with the react which taught me how to make custom alert and make the page responsive.
